# HPAStain.R
A small tool and shiny app I'm making that allows one to query Human Protein Atlas's cell staining data using a list of genes.

The source data used in this tool comes from: https://www.proteinatlas.org/download/normal_tissue.tsv.zip

This is my first time developing a tool on github, any and all feedback is appreciated!
